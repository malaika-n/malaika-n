Recently graduated cum laude from California Lutheran University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I'm passionate about transforming complex data into actionable insights by using them to make data-driven decisions. Through my education and experience with projects, I have developed strong statistical and programming skills and gained experience in Machine Learning, Linear Algebra, Calculus, Data Cleaning, and Visualization.
I founded and served as the president of my university's Women In STEM Club as I am passionate about closing the gender gap in computing and furthering diverse representation in the field.

I am currently looking for entry-level opportunities within the Data Science field.
