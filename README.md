I am a graduate student at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT), pursuing a Master's in Data Science and AI. With a solid foundation in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, I am dedicated to applying data-driven strategies to foster business growth and innovation.

I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science (Cum Laude) from California Lutheran University, where I also minored in Mathematics. My professional experience includes serving as a Data Analyst and Generative AI Intern at Neilsoft, where I successfully enhanced customer satisfaction and product positioning through detailed data analysis and visualization.

In addition, I am the founder and former president of the Women in STEM Club at California Lutheran University, where I led initiatives to support and empower women in STEM through events and mentorship programs.

I am currently seeking Data Science internship opportunities to further apply my technical expertise in a professional environment.
